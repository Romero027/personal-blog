### [Early Detection of Configuration Errors to Reduce Failure Damage](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/osdi16/osdi16-xu.pdf) - Xu et al., OSDI' 16

This paper is about detecting latent configuration\(LC\) errors. Typically, at the startup time, only those configuration parameters needed for initialization are checked\(or directly used\), while many other parameters' checking is delayed much later until when they are used.
