# Introduction

I include some interesting papers\(mostly about computer systems\) I've read and my summary/thoughts about the paper. 

**In the summaries, I will try to answer the following questions:** 

-What problem does the paper solve? Is it important? 

-How does it solve the problem? 

-How does their approach differ from previous ones? Are they adequately discussed in the reading? 

-How does this work relate to other research? 

-What could be improved? 

**Disclaimer: These notes are just for my future self to look back and review the materials on these paper, without reading them all over again.**
