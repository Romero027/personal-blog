### Neural Adaptive Content-aware Internet Video Delivery - Yeo et al., OSDI' 18

The key idea of this paper is to use super-resolution, a technique that uses DNN to recover a high-resolution image from lower resolution images, on top of ABR to enhance client-side video quality. It will train a DNN for each video, exploiting DNN's inherent overfitting property to guarantee reliable and superior performance.
