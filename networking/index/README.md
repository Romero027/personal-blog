* [**Salsify: Low-Latency Network Video through Tighter Integration between a Video Codec and a Transport Protocol**](https://cs.stanford.edu/~keithw/salsify-paper.pdf) - Fouladi et al., NSDIâ€™ 18
  * Proposes a tightly coupled codec and transport protocol
  * Exploits its codec's ability to save and restore its internal state
